### RobotlegsJS

A port of [Robotlegs Framework](https://github.com/robotlegs/robotlegs-framework) to TypeScript/JavaScript.

Features
---

- Dependency injection (through [InversifyJS](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS))
- Command management
- View management

Motivation
---

There is plenty of frameworks and patterns out there that helps you to write
DOM-based applications. There is no scalable solution yet to architecture a
canvas-based application though.

Robotlegs has proven itself of being a mature solution from the ActionScript
community for interactive experiences.
